This is Lua 5.2.3, released on 11 Nov 2013.

Modified for MVS/MVC++ and MVC++ compiler. This is a customized lua which is (Almost) as same as Garry's mod lua interface.

For building the project, you'll need the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler, which is by default included in Microsoft Visual studio.

This project is forked from [NLua's lua lib](https://github.com/NLua/lua), which is forked from [C lua by LuaDist ](https://github.com/LuaDist/lua).
